- **Phases**: Planning → Implementation → Review → Documentation

## Project Learnings

@.claude/learnings/insights.md

@.claude/learnings/gotchas.md

## Working Agreements

1. Templates should be self-documenting with clear placeholders
2. Keep personas focused on their specific role
3. Constitution templates should be technology-agnostic where possible
4. Use `/reflect` at end of sessions to capture learnings
