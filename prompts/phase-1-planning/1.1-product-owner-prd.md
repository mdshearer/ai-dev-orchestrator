# Prompt: Product Owner - PRD Generation

**Persona:** Product Owner
**Phase:** 1 - Planning and Design
**Purpose:** Transform user requirements into a formal Product Requirement Document (PRD)

---

## When to Use This Prompt

✅ **Use when:**
- Starting a new feature or project
- You have a rough idea that needs formalization
- A stakeholder requested a feature but requirements are unclear

❌ **Don't use when:**
- You already have a detailed PRD
- You're ready to design the technical implementation

---

## The Prompt Template

```markdown
You are a Product Owner. Your task is to turn my user requirements into a formal Product Requirement Document (PRD).

**Rules:**
1. You must adhere to all principles in the attached `CONSTITUTION.md` file.
2. The PRD must be in Markdown format.
3. The output must be a single file.
4. The PRD must include:
   - A high-level description of the feature (2-3 sentences)
   - A list of "User Stories" using the format: "As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
   - A list of "Acceptance Criteria" for each user story (clear, testable conditions)
   - (Optional) Success metrics - how will we measure if this feature is successful?
   - (Optional) Out of scope - what this feature explicitly does NOT include
5. **CRITICAL:** If my requirements are unclear or ambiguous, you MUST ask clarifying questions before generating the PRD. Do not guess or make assumptions.

**Output Format:**
- Save the PRD in the `docs/` directory
- The filename must be in kebab-case and end with the `-prd.md` suffix
- Example: `docs/user-authentication-prd.md`, `docs/csv-export-prd.md`

**Files to Reference:**
- CONSTITUTION.md (for project principles and constraints)
- [Any existing related PRDs or documentation]

---

Here is the feature I want to build:

[YOUR FEATURE DESCRIPTION - paste your idea, user request, or stakeholder requirement here]

---

**Additional Context** (optional but helpful):
- Target users: [who will use this feature?]
- Problem being solved: [what user pain point does this address?]
- Existing related features: [what features does this relate to?]
```

---

## How to Use This Prompt

### Step 1: Prepare Your Input

Gather:
- [ ] `CONSTITUTION.md` from your project
- [ ] Your feature idea or requirement
- [ ] Any existing documentation
- [ ] Context about users and their needs

### Step 2: Fill in the Template

Replace `[YOUR FEATURE DESCRIPTION]` with your actual requirement. Be as detailed or as vague as you want - the Product Owner will ask questions if needed.

### Step 3: Invoke the AI

Paste the filled-in prompt to your AI assistant (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)

### Step 4: Answer Clarifying Questions

The Product Owner may ask questions like:
- "Who are the users of this feature?"
- "What should happen if [edge case]?"
- "Should this feature include [related functionality]?"

Answer these thoroughly - they improve the PRD quality.

### Step 5: Review the Generated PRD

Check for:
- [ ] Do the user stories actually solve the user's problem?
- [ ] Are the acceptance criteria testable and specific?
- [ ] Is the scope clear (what's included and what's not)?
- [ ] Does it align with CONSTITUTION.md principles?

### Step 6: Iterate if Needed

If the PRD isn't quite right:
- Ask for specific revisions: "Add acceptance criteria for error handling"
- Provide more context: "Actually, this feature also needs to support..."
- Request clarifications: "What does 'responsive' mean in this context?"

## Example Input

```markdown
Here is the feature I want to build:

I want users to be able to reset their passwords if they forget them. They should get an email with a link.

Additional Context:
- Target users: Internal employees of our company (~200 people)
- Problem being solved: Too many help desk tickets for password resets
- Existing related features: We have basic email/password login
```

---

## Example Output (What the Product Owner Should Generate)

```markdown
# Feature: Password Reset

**File:** `docs/password-reset-prd.md`

## Description

A self-service password reset feature that allows users to securely reset their forgotten passwords via email verification, reducing help desk load and improving user experience.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Request Password Reset
**As a** user who forgot my password,
**I want to** request a password reset via email,
**So that** I can regain access to my account without contacting IT support.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can access a "Forgot Password?" link on the login page
- [ ] User enters their email address
- [ ] System sends a password reset email within 2 minutes
- [ ] System shows a success message even if email doesn't exist (security: prevent email enumeration)
- [ ] Reset link expires after 1 hour
- [ ] Rate limiting: Maximum 3 reset requests per email per hour

### Story 2: Reset Password via Email Link
**As a** user who requested a password reset,
**I want to** click a link in the email and set a new password,
**So that** I can access my account again.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Email contains a secure, single-use token in the reset link
- [ ] Clicking the link opens a "Set New Password" page
- [ ] User must enter password twice (confirmation)
- [ ] Password must meet complexity requirements (per CONSTITUTION.md)
- [ ] After successful reset, user is redirected to login page
- [ ] User receives a confirmation email that password was changed
- [ ] All existing sessions are invalidated (security)

### Story 3: Handle Invalid/Expired Reset Links
**As a** user who clicks an expired or invalid reset link,
**I want to** receive a clear error message,
**So that** I know I need to request a new reset link.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Expired links show: "This reset link has expired. Please request a new one."
- [ ] Already-used links show: "This reset link has already been used."
- [ ] Invalid links show: "This reset link is invalid."
- [ ] All error pages include a link to request a new reset

## Success Metrics

- Help desk password reset tickets reduced by 80%
- 95% of users successfully reset passwords without help
- Average time to reset: < 5 minutes

## Out of Scope

- Multi-factor authentication (future feature)
- Password reset via SMS (email only for v1)
- Admin-initiated password resets (separate feature)

## Dependencies

- Email service (existing: `src/services/email.service.ts`)
- User database (existing: `users` table)

## Tips for Better PRDs

### ✅ DO:
- Start with a clear, concise description
- Write user stories from the user's perspective
- Make acceptance criteria specific and testable
- Include security and error-handling scenarios
- Define what's out of scope
- Consider edge cases

### ❌ DON'T:
- Specify technical implementation (that's for the Solutions Architect)
- Write vague criteria like "it should work well"
- Skip the "why" (the user benefit)
- Include multiple unrelated features in one PRD

---

## Common Clarifying Questions the Product Owner Might Ask

Be prepared to answer:

1. **User Context:**
   - Who exactly will use this feature?
   - How many users are we expecting?

2. **Scope:**
   - What should happen when [edge case]?
   - Should this include [related functionality]?

3. **Constraints:**
   - Are there any deadlines or budget constraints?
   - Any security/compliance requirements?

4. **Success:**
   - How will we know if this feature is successful?
   - What's the minimum viable version?

## Next Steps After PRD Approval

Once you've reviewed and approved the PRD:

1. **Save it** to `docs/[feature-name]-prd.md`
2. **Move to Phase 1.2:** Use the Solutions Architect to create a Tech Spec
3. **Reference:** See [1.2-architect-tech-spec.md](./1.2-architect-tech-spec.md)
