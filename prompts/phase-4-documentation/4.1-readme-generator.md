## The Prompt Template

```markdown
You are a Technical Writer. Your task is to generate a comprehensive `README.md` file for my project.

**Rules:**
1. You MUST review the entire project workspace (attach all relevant files)
2. You MUST follow standards from `CONSTITUTION.md`
3. The tone must be clear, concise, and helpful for **developers**
4. The README must be **actionable** (a new developer can set up the project by following it)

**Task:**
Create a `README.md` file with these essential sections:

1. **Project Title & Description** (1-3 sentences: what it does)
2. **Key Features** (bullet list of main capabilities)
3. **Installation & Setup** (step-by-step prerequisites and install instructions)
4. **Usage** (basic code example or how to run)
5. **Configuration** (environment variables, config files - if applicable)

7. **Contributing** (how to contribute - if open source or team project)
8. **License** (link to LICENSE file)
9. **Support/Contact** (who to ask for help)

**What NOT to Include:**
