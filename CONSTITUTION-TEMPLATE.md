# Project Constitution Template

> **INSTRUCTIONS:** Copy this file to the root of your new project and customize it. This document contains the non-negotiable principles and standards for your project. All AI-generated code, documentation, and analysis MUST adhere to these rules.

---

## 1. Core Principles (The "Why")

**Function over Aesthetics**
- This is an [internal tool / web app / API / etc.]. Speed, reliability, simplicity, and ease of use are prioritized over complex visual design or animations.
- Aesthetic design is subservient to function.

**User is Sovereign**
- All features must be driven by explicit user needs. We "Start with user needs".
- No features are built without clear user stories or acceptance criteria.

**Simplicity Beats Complexity**
- Avoid over-engineering. Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over complex or "clever" ones.
- When in doubt, choose the simpler approach.
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - don't build features speculatively.

**What "Simplicity" MEANS:**
- ✅ Choose proven, well-documented tools over cutting-edge experiments
- ✅ Prefer explicit code over "clever" abstractions
- ✅ One canonical way to do things, not multiple competing patterns
- ✅ Readable code over compact code
- ✅ Boring technology that works over exciting technology that might not

**What "Simplicity" does NOT MEAN:**
- ❌ Avoiding type safety (TypeScript adds safety, reduces debugging)
- ❌ Skipping validation libraries (Zod reduces code vs manual validation)
- ❌ Reinventing wheels to avoid dependencies
- ❌ Using weaker tools because they have fewer features

**Litmus test:** Will a developer new to the project understand this in 30 seconds?

**Accessibility is Mandatory**
- All UI components and user flows must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).
- All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable.
- All images must have alt text.
- Color contrast must meet accessibility standards.

## 2. AI Model Assumptions

This constitution is designed for AI assistants with capabilities of:
- **Minimum:** Claude Sonnet 4 / GPT-4 / Gemini 1.5 Pro
- **Recommended:** Claude Opus 4+ for complex architecture decisions

**Assumed capabilities:**
- Strong TypeScript comprehension and generation
- Multi-file context understanding (50k+ tokens)
- Schema-aware code generation
- Ability to follow explicit constraints

**If using older/smaller models, consider:**
- More explicit inline comments explaining intent
- Smaller file sizes (<300 lines)
- Simpler type hierarchies (avoid deep generics)
- More frequent checkpoints and reviews

---

## 3. Technical Stack (The "What")

### Mandated Technologies

**Frontend:**
- Framework: [e.g., React 18+, Vue 3, Svelte, Next.js]
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- File extensions: .tsx for React components, .ts for utilities
- Type imports: `import type { ... }` for type-only imports
- Styling: [e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components]
- State Management: [e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit, Pinia]

**Backend:**
- Framework: [e.g., FastAPI, Express.js, Django, Flask]
- Language: [e.g., Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+, Go 1.21+]
- API Style: [e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC]

**Database:**
- Primary: [e.g., PostgreSQL 15+, MongoDB 7+, SQLite]
- Caching: [e.g., Redis, Memcached, N/A]

**Infrastructure:**
- Platform: [e.g., Docker, AWS Lambda, Vercel, Railway]
- CI/CD: [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI]

### Prohibited Technologies

- ❌ [e.g., jQuery - use modern vanilla JS or framework]
- ❌ [e.g., Bootstrap - use Tailwind CSS]
- ❌ [e.g., Class components in React - use functional components with hooks]
- ❌ [e.g., Mongoose - use raw MongoDB driver or Prisma]

---

## 4. Type Sharing (Full-Stack TypeScript)

**Single Source of Truth:**
- All data types defined ONCE in `shared/schema.ts` (or `types/`)
- Frontend imports types directly from shared location
- No manual type duplication between frontend and backend
- API responses typed with schema types, never `any`

**Pattern:**
```typescript
// shared/schema.ts - AUTHORITATIVE
export type User = { id: number; name: string; email: string };

// Backend - imports from shared
import type { User } from '../shared/schema';

// Frontend - imports from shared
import type { User } from '@shared/schema';
```

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Redefining types in frontend that exist in backend
- ❌ Using `any` for API responses
- ❌ Manual type guards when schema types exist

---

## 5. Coding Standards (The "How")

### Language & Style

**Language Version:**
- [e.g., TypeScript 5+ (strict mode enabled)]
- [e.g., Python 3.11+ with type hints]

**Style Guide:**
- [e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide]
- [e.g., PEP 8 for Python]
- [e.g., Effective Go for Go]

**Linting & Formatting:**
- Linter: [e.g., ESLint, Pylint, golangci-lint]
- Formatter: [e.g., Prettier, Black, gofmt]
- All code must pass linting before commit.

### Naming Conventions

**Variables & Functions:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `camelCase` (e.g., `getUserData`, `isValid`)
- Python: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_user_data`, `is_valid`)
- Go: `camelCase` (exported: `PascalCase`)

**Classes & Types:**
- All languages: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserService`, `ApiResponse`)

**Constants:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`)
- Python: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)

**Files:**
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Utilities: `kebab-case.ts` (e.g., `api-client.ts`)
- Python modules: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `user_service.py`)

### Code Organization

**File Structure:**
```
[Define your project structure here, e.g.,
src/
  components/     # React components
  services/       # Business logic
  utils/          # Utility functions
  types/          # TypeScript types
  api/            # API route handlers
tests/
  unit/
  integration/
]
```

**Import Order:**
1. External dependencies (e.g., `react`, `express`)
2. Internal absolute imports (e.g., `@/components`)
3. Relative imports (e.g., `./utils`)
4. Type imports (TypeScript)

### Comments & Documentation

**Required Comments:**
- All public functions, classes, and methods must have documentation headers.
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: JSDoc format
  - Python: Google-style or NumPy-style docstrings
  - Go: GoDoc format

**Comment Quality:**
- Comments must explain the **why** (intent), not the **what** (syntax).
- ❌ Bad: `// Loop through users`
- ✅ Good: `// Filter out inactive users to reduce API payload size`

**Inline Comments:**
- Use sparingly, only for complex logic or business rules.
- Place comments above the code they describe.

### Error Handling

**API Responses:**
- All API endpoints must return consistent error structures:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "User-friendly error message",
    "details": { /* optional field-specific errors */ }
  }
}
```

**Exception Handling:**
- Never use bare `try/catch` or `try/except` blocks without specific error handling.
- Log all errors with context (user ID, request ID, timestamp).
- Never expose stack traces or internal errors to end users.

### Testing Requirements

**Coverage Thresholds:**
| Area | Minimum | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| Business logic | 70% | 85% |
| Utility functions | 80% | 95% |
| API endpoints | 70% | 80% |
| UI components | 50% | 70% |

**"Adequate testing" checklist:**
- [ ] Happy path tested with realistic data
- [ ] Error cases tested (invalid input, network failures)
- [ ] Edge cases for user input (empty, too long, special chars)
- [ ] API contract validated (request/response shapes)
- [ ] Critical user flows have integration tests

**Testing philosophy:**
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests for API boundaries
- Mock external services, not internal modules

**Test Types:**
- Unit tests: [e.g., Jest, pytest, Go testing]
- Integration tests: [e.g., Supertest, pytest with fixtures]
- E2E tests: [e.g., Playwright, Cypress] (optional for internal tools)

---

## 4. Security & Compliance (The "Musts")

### Data Handling

**Personal Identifiable Information (PII):**
- ❌ Never log PII (emails, names, addresses, phone numbers).
- ❌ Never store PII in plain text.
- ✅ Always encrypt PII at rest.
- ✅ Always use HTTPS for data in transit.

**Secrets Management:**
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- ✅ All secrets must be stored in environment variables.
- ✅ Use a secrets manager in production (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication:**
- Method: [e.g., OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, Auth0, Firebase Auth]
- Session duration: [e.g., 24 hours with refresh tokens]
- Password requirements: [e.g., min 12 characters, must include special characters]

**Authorization:**
- All API endpoints must verify user permissions before execution.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).

### Input Validation

**All user input must be validated:**
- ✅ Validate on both client and server side.
- ✅ Sanitize all inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- ✅ Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- ✅ Validate file uploads (type, size, content).

### Security Headers

**All HTTP responses must include:**
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)

---

## 5. Git & Version Control

### Commit Messages

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature

## 6. Performance Standards

### API Performance

**Response Times:**
- Target: 95th percentile < [e.g., 200ms]
- Maximum: [e.g., 2 seconds]

**Database Queries:**
- Avoid N+1 queries (use eager loading, joins, or batching).
- All queries must use indexes for frequently accessed fields.
- Limit query result sets (pagination required for lists).

### Frontend Performance

**Bundle Size:**
- Target: Initial bundle < [e.g., 200KB gzipped]
- Code splitting required for routes.

**Images:**
- All images must be optimized (WebP format preferred).
- Use lazy loading for images below the fold.
- Provide responsive images with `srcset`.

**Core Web Vitals Targets:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- FID (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

---

## 7. Deployment & Operations

### Environment Strategy

**Environments:**
- `development`: Local development
- `staging`: Pre-production testing
- `production`: Live environment

**Environment Variables:**
- Never commit `.env` files to version control.
- Use `.env.example` as a template with dummy values.

### Monitoring & Logging

**Required Logging:**
- All API requests (method, path, status code, duration)
- All errors with stack traces and context
- All authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)

**Log Levels:**
- `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging
- `INFO`: General informational messages
- `WARN`: Warning messages (non-critical issues)
- `ERROR`: Error messages (requires attention)

**Monitoring:**
- Service: [e.g., Sentry, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch]
- Alerts for: [e.g., error rate > 1%, API latency > 2s, 5xx errors]
